# Parabolic Shooter Game
A game that illustrates the idea that particles passing through a parabola's focus will bounce off it its walls in parallel directions.

## Built With:
- p5.js
- Matter.js

## Stretch Goals:
- Set up a sprinkler function that moves from left to right, spraying the parabola with photons
- A faster shot costs more power, and your power replenishes at a constant rate (can only shoot if you have power)
- Let user adjust parabola
- User losers more power for faster shots; shots cost power that regenerates constantly over time
- Obstacles of random width and speed fly in toward the player (his base, his focus, his home!)
- Obstacles can have more or less health, depicted by size/color
- Add in walls to disallow player from shooting directly
- Oh it would be nuts if there were health boxes that you could only access if you hit them *after* hitting an intruder, bouncing off parabola, going back through focus and hitting the health box
